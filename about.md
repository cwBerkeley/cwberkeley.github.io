<strong>A working group at <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu">the University of California, Berkeley</a></strong> that focuses on the transformative role of information technology on modern energy systems.  Cleanweb Berkeley shares knowledge, supports new ventures and enterprises, and builds tools together to do data-driven science, market, and policy research.

- Cultivating and supporting enterprise and new ventures in science, policy, and business.
- Defining an open science agenda for supporting next generation energy systems.
- Building shared research infrastructure (open source code and datasets) for energy research and policy development in a data-driven world.
- Creating opportunities for collaboration through hack-a-thons, meetings, and events.
- Partnering with like-minded groups across the Berkeley campus and beyond (like the <a href="http://breg.berkeley.edu">Berkeley Rural Energy Group</a>)


<strong>NOTE</strong>: There used to be a group called "infoEnergy"...now combined with Cleanweb Berkeley. The new group kept the CWB name.

During the Fall and Spring we'll meet every <strong>Monday from 4-5 PM</strong> in the <a href="http://dlab.berkeley.edu/contact-and-address">D-Lab</a>
convening room in Barrows Hall room 356 (on the western end of the third floor) at UC Berkeley.
