Cleanweb Berkeley Sept. 22 2014:
=====================================

# NEXT WEEK:

Working meeting. -- come up with outcomes.

TODO: before next meeting:

**Project leaders** send two powerpoint slides to [john's email address] for pitches at undergraduate hack-a-thon.

**All** email project leaders if you're interested in contributing to the project they are leading (see below).  Regular attendance to the meetings is not required to participate (for all you email lurkers), although of course it will help amplify your contributions if we are doing the meetings right.  

**Anyone**: some skills that seem common (and could be the subject of a skill presentation) I have so far are:

d3 Javascript for visualization
web scraping / API munging
databases -- general principles and deploying on the web -- Django?  Anna mentioned this today.
Geospatial work

Others want to add to this list? **Reply to the group email** Volunteer to present or know someone good on campus?
