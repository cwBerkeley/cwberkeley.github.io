This meeting is to kick off, in a sense, the project working group meetings phase of the slow-burn hack-a-thon.  

We are rolling with a good head of steam on the semester and all are welcome and encouraged to come join a group (either by coming to the meetings, or virtually). Or, come hang out at the meeting and hear what we have going on.
