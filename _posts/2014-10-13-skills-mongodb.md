We've got a fantastic meeting in the queue this afternoon, with the inimitable Dav Clark presenting on MongoDB for the "Skill Presentation".  

MongoDB is a NoSQL, open-source database framework with a great name.
<http://www.mongodb.org/>

The whole agenda:

1. Hellos and Announcements
2. MongoDB Skills +1
3. Project check-in
