title: Welcome to Cleanweb Berkeley
---
<p>
  <strong>A working group at <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu">the University
      of California, Berkeley</a></strong> that focuses on the transformative
  role of information technology on modern energy systems.  Cleanweb Berkeley
  shares knowledge, supports new ventures and enterprises, and builds tools
  together to do data-driven science, market, and policy research.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cultivating and supporting enterprise and new ventures in science,
    policy, and business.
  <li>Defining an open science agenda for supporting next generation energy
    systems.
  <li>Building shared research
    infrastructure (open source code and datasets) for energy research and
    policy development in a data-driven world.
  <li>Creating opportunities
    for collaboration through hack-a-thons, meetings, and events.
  <li>Partnering with like-minded groups across the Berkeley campus and beyond
    (like the <a href="http://breg.berkeley.edu">Berkeley Rural Energy
      Group</a>)
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>NOTE</strong>: There used to be a group called "infoEnergy"...now
  combined with Cleanweb Berkeley. The new group kept the CWB name.

Putting the capture all on one line avoids indentation leading
to a code snippet. This is now completely disabled, as we have a post-list in
the sidebar.
