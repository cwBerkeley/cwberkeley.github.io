{"name":"infoEnergy","tagline":"Nexus Working Group","body":"### Welcome to the Information-Energy Nexus\r\n**A working group at [the University of California, Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu)** that focuses on the transformative role of information technology on modern energy systems.  infoEnergy shares knowledge and builds tools together to do data-driven science, market, and policy research.\r\n\r\n- Defining an open science agenda for supporting next generation energy systems.\r\n- Building shared research infrastructure (open source code and datasets) for energy research and policy development in a data-driven world.\r\n- Partnering with like-minded groups across the Berkeley campus and beyond (like [Cleanweb Berkeley](http://berkeley.cleanweb.co) and the [Berkeley Rural Energy Group](http://breg.berkeley.edu))\r\n- Organizing a conference / workshop for Summer 2014 \r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nWe create and curate open-source code.\r\nWe find and share links with open data.\r\nCheck it out in the repositories.\r\n\r\nLatest Addition: CAISO market data API functions for R...\r\nAnd now there's a demo of using the CAISO functions too.\r\n\r\nMore to come...\r\n```\r\n![[infoEnergy]](http://www.alstone.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/infoEnergy-logo2-icon.jpg)\r\n\r\nGo to the repositories at [github.com/infoenergy](http://github.com/infoenergy) and join the effort.\r\n\r\n## Schedule\r\nWe meet every other week at the [D-Lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu) convening room in Barrows Hall room 356 (on the western end of the third floor) at UC Berkeley.\r\n\r\n### Next Meeting\r\n**April 11, 2014 from Noon-1 PM**\r\n\r\n**Agenda**\r\nAndrew Crane-Droesch discusses challenges and opportunities for Tablet Computer Surveys (using Open Data Kit).  \r\n\r\nWe broadcast parts of our meetings and archive basic notes publicly on [a google plus page](https://plus.google.com/b/112947358931165650753/112947358931165650753/about).\r\n\r\n### Typical Meeting Agenda\r\n*Tools and Datasets (20-30 min)*\r\n- Learn about a new analysis tool or software package with demos\r\n- Get a tour and explore a dataset or API \r\n\r\n*Discussion and collaboration (20-30 min)*\r\n- Collaboratively define and execute an open data science agenda for energy \r\n- Plan events (hackathon, workshop, etc.)\r\n- Find collaborators and workshop project ideas\r\n\r\n\r\n### Meeting Archive\r\n\r\n[March 14, 2014](https://plus.google.com/b/112947358931165650753/events/cs4map02c6bjftdglt2sspo1m1o)\r\n\r\n[February 28, 2014](https://plus.google.com/b/112947358931165650753/events/cglpm92gtk43j8it3h46hot2nd4)\r\n\r\n[February 14, 2014](https://plus.google.com/b/112947358931165650753/events/cih2r42df1464h7po891lqb8tcg)\r\n\r\n## Connect\r\n[Join the google group to stay up-to-date.](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/infoenergy)\r\n\r\n## Links\r\n\r\n### D-Lab\r\nThe [D-Lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/) supports data-intense social science research at UC Berkeley.  Our interdisciplinary group meets is a [D-Lab working group](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/working-groups) and we meet in a D-Lab convening space.  \r\n\r\n### Berkeley Rural Energy Group\r\n[BREG](http://breg.berkeley.edu) is an important partner for infoEnergy's work in the off-grid space, providing a forum for engaging practitioners and academics who are working on energy issues in the developing world.  \r\n\r\n### Cleanweb Berkeley\r\nWorking with [Cleanweb](http://berkeley.cleanweb.co) we contribute to developing ventures and startups that can take information technology ideas to scale in the private and public sectors.  \r\n\r\n### Berkeley Energy and Resources Collaborative\r\nWe are a [BERC Community](http://berc.berkeley.edu/programs/berc-communities/).\r\n\r\n## Archive\r\n[This was the flyer from the first meeting](http://www.alstone.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/infoEnergyAnnounce-799x1024.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
