{"name":"infoEnergy","tagline":"Open Data Science Working Group","body":"## Welcome to the infoEnergy Nexus\r\nWe are a working group at [the University of California, Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu) that focuses on the transformative role of information technology on modern energy systems.  The group shares knowledge and builds tools together, and is mostly made up of researchers and students who are working on our 'own' projects. \r\n\r\n```\r\nWe are sharing code :)\r\n\r\nThe general repository is seeded with a \r\nfile that provides easy interface with \r\nthe CAISO OASIS portal for downloading \r\nCA electricity market data.  \r\n\r\nMore to come...\r\n```\r\nGo to the repositories at [github.com/infoenergy](http://github.com/infoenergy) and join the effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Schedule\r\nWe meet every other week at the D-Lab in Barrows Hall room 356 (D-lab convening room on the western side of the third floor) at UC Berkeley.\r\n\r\nWe will try to enable remote participation by Google Hangout but can't guarantee that will be a smooth process at first.  More info on this soon.\r\n\r\n### Next Meeting\r\n**February 14, 2014 from Noon-1 PM**\r\n\r\nAgenda\r\n- Discuss currently known / available resources for open energy data and analysis.\r\n- Develop a plan for the semester.  What are the core activities we can do as a working group to add value?\r\n- Other topics welcome.\r\n\r\n## Connect\r\n[Join the google group to stay up-to-date.](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/infoenergy)\r\n\r\n## Partners\r\n\r\n### Cleanweb Berkeley\r\n[Cleanweb](http://berkeley.cleanweb.co) is the other \"half\" of our infoEnergy Nexus Working Groups Community.  Through Cleanweb we develop ventures, hacks, and startups that can take information technology ideas to scale in the private and public sector.  \r\n\r\n### Berkeley Rural Energy Group\r\n[BREG](http://breg.berkeley.edu) is an important partner for infoEnergy, providing a forum for engaging practitioners and academics who are working on energy issues in the developing world.  \r\n\r\n## Archive\r\nThis was the flyer from the first meeting: \r\n![infoEnergy Nexus Working Group](http://www.alstone.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/infoEnergyAnnounce-799x1024.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
