{"name":"Cleanweb Berkley","tagline":"Working Group","body":"### Welcome to Cleanweb Berkeley\r\n\r\n**A working group at [the University of California, Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu)** that focuses on the transformative role of information technology on modern energy systems.  Cleanweb Berkeley shares knowledge, supports new ventures and enterprises, and builds tools together to do data-driven science, market, and policy research.\r\n\r\n- Cultivating and supporting enterprise and new ventures in science, policy, and business.\r\n- Defining an open science agenda for supporting next generation energy systems.\r\n- Building shared research infrastructure (open source code and datasets) for energy research and policy development in a data-driven world.\r\n- Creating opportunities for collaboration through hack-a-thons, meetings, and events.\r\n- Partnering with like-minded groups across the Berkeley campus and beyond (like the [Berkeley Rural Energy Group](http://breg.berkeley.edu))\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: There used to be a group called \"infoEnergy\"...now combined with Cleanweb Berkeley. The new group kept the CWB name.\r\n\r\n## Connect\r\n[Join the google group to stay up-to-date.](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cwberkeley)\r\n\r\n## Schedule\r\nDuring the Fall and Spring we meet every week at the [D-Lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu) convening room in Barrows Hall room 356 (on the western end of the third floor) at UC Berkeley.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more details soon on meetings for Fall 2014.\r\n\r\n### Next Meeting\r\n\r\n**The last two meetings Spring 2014:**\r\n\r\n*April 25*: Visualization demos: several people do quick demos of interesting data vis tool.  \r\n[Discuss](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/07/opinion/eight-no-nine-problems-with-big-data.html?_r=0) [big](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/05/big-data-picks-up-the-pace/) [data](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6176/1203).\r\n\r\n*May 9*: Last meeting of the academic spring semester.  Recap what we've done and plan for summer and fall based on our goals for the group.\r\n  \r\nWe broadcast parts of our meetings and archive basic notes publicly on [a google plus page](https://plus.google.com/b/112947358931165650753/112947358931165650753/about).\r\n\r\n### Typical Meeting Agenda\r\n*Tools and Datasets (20-30 min)*\r\n- Learn about a new analysis tool or software package with demos\r\n- Get a tour and explore a dataset or API \r\n\r\n*Discussion and collaboration (20-30 min)*\r\n- Topical discussion\r\n- Plan events (hackathon, workshop, etc.)\r\n- Catalyze projects\r\n\r\n```\r\nWe create and curate open-source code.\r\nWe find and share links with open data.\r\nCheck it out in the repositories.\r\n\r\nLatest Addition: CAISO market data API functions for R...\r\nAnd now there's a demo of using the CAISO functions too.\r\n\r\nMore to come...\r\n```\r\nGo to the repositories at [github.com/cwberkeley](http://github.com/cwberkeley) and join the effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Meeting Archive (for infoEnergy Group Spring 2014)\r\n\r\n[April 11, 2014](https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/112947358931165650753/events/ccvl6pqt11bj2pj0nbq331po3ok)\r\n\r\nMarch 28, 2014: No Meeting\r\n[March 14, 2014](https://plus.google.com/b/112947358931165650753/events/cs4map02c6bjftdglt2sspo1m1o)\r\n\r\n[February 28, 2014](https://plus.google.com/b/112947358931165650753/events/cglpm92gtk43j8it3h46hot2nd4)\r\n\r\n[February 14, 2014](https://plus.google.com/b/112947358931165650753/events/cih2r42df1464h7po891lqb8tcg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Links\r\n\r\n### D-Lab\r\nThe [D-Lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/) supports data-intense social science research at UC Berkeley.  Our interdisciplinary group meets is a [D-Lab working group](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/working-groups) and we meet in a D-Lab convening space.  \r\n\r\n### Berkeley Rural Energy Group\r\n[BREG](http://breg.berkeley.edu) is an important partner for infoEnergy's work in the off-grid space, providing a forum for engaging practitioners and academics who are working on energy issues in the developing world.  \r\n\r\n### Berkeley Energy and Resources Collaborative\r\nWe are a [BERC Community](http://berc.berkeley.edu/programs/berc-communities/).\r\n\r\n## Archive\r\n[This was the flyer from the first infoEnergy meeting](http://www.alstone.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/infoEnergyAnnounce-799x1024.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
