{"name":"infoEnergy","tagline":"Nexus Working Group","body":"### Welcome to the Information-Energy Nexus\r\nWe are a working group at [the University of California, Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu) that focuses on the transformative role of information technology on modern energy systems.  infoEnergy shares knowledge and builds tools together, and is mostly made up of researchers and students who are working on our 'own' projects. We are currently partnered with [Cleanweb Berkeley](http://berkeley.cleanweb.co) and the [Berkeley Rural Energy Group](http://breg.berkeley.edu) to extend our reach.\r\n\r\n```\r\nWe create and curate open-source code :)\r\n\r\nThe general repository is seeded with a \r\nfile that provides easy interface with \r\nthe CAISO OASIS portal for downloading \r\nCA electricity market data.  \r\n\r\nMore to come...\r\n```\r\nGo to the repositories at [github.com/infoenergy](http://github.com/infoenergy) and join the effort.\r\n\r\n## Schedule\r\nWe meet every other week at the [D-Lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu) convening room in Barrows Hall room 356 (on the western end of the third floor) at UC Berkeley.\r\n\r\nWe will try to enable remote participation via a Google Hangout but can't guarantee that will be a smooth process at first.  More info on this soon.\r\n\r\n### Next Meeting\r\n**February 14, 2014 from Noon-1 PM**\r\n\r\nAgenda\r\n- Discuss currently known / available resources for open energy data and analysis.\r\n- Develop a plan for the semester.  What are the core activities we can do as a working group to add value?\r\n- Other topics welcome.\r\n\r\n**\"Homework\" for Next Meeting**\r\n\r\nPlease contribute to the two shared google docs:\r\n\r\n[A document to aggregate what we know about available code and data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlEgjnBoKZKqdFdFZTdlZ3pYbXZsWVRET3dYUkR6OVE&usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n[Another document for a crowd-sourced list of research groups and projects that are active in the info-energy space](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlEgjnBoKZKqdGd5ajBmMERfTzdzcDF3czdLX0tnWUE#gid=0)\r\n\r\n## Connect\r\n[Join the google group to stay up-to-date.](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/infoenergy)\r\n\r\n## Partners\r\n\r\n### Cleanweb Berkeley\r\nWorking with [Cleanweb](http://berkeley.cleanweb.co) we contribute to developing ventures and startups that can take information technology ideas to scale in the private and public sectors.  \r\n\r\n### Berkeley Rural Energy Group\r\n[BREG](http://breg.berkeley.edu) is an important partner for infoEnergy's work in the off-grid space, providing a forum for engaging practitioners and academics who are working on energy issues in the developing world.  \r\n\r\n## Archive\r\nThis was the flyer from the first meeting: \r\n![infoEnergy Nexus Working Group](http://www.alstone.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/infoEnergyAnnounce-799x1024.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
